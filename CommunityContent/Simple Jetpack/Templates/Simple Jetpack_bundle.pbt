    Description: "This is a basic jumppack/jetpack equipment that gives players a single boost after pressing the jetpack binding (SHIFT by default).\r\n\r\nThe jetpack has several properties that can be adjsuted to fit the needs of the creator. Read the JETPACK_READ_ME script for more details. Otherwise, the jetpack is drag and drop friendly; it has its own pickup trigger and has default settings to allow the jetpack to work without any adjustments.\r\n\r\n(This is a very similar jetpack used in the game SENTRY CRATER. It has been modified to make tweaking the jetpack properties easier)\r\n\r\nCredit to Aj for the DashServerExperimental script from his Multi-Directional Dash Ability found in Community Content."
